To any students studying Biomedical Engineering at the University of Waterloo currently completing their BME 261 design projects 
- congrats on being resourceful. Feel free to use  our ideas, adapt our code, and take this project even further. Some algorithmic things 
to try would be to have the SVM consider more features, and test classifiers other than the SVM. Enjoy!
